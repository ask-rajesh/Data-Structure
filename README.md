## What is Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Types of Data Structure

* ### Linear Data Structures
In linear data structures, data elements are arranged sequentially, meaning each element has a unique predecessor and successor (except for the first and last elements). This sequential arrangement allows for linear traversal of the data structure.

Common linear data structures include:

* Array
* Stack
* Queue

    * Normal Queue
    * Circular Queue
* Linked List

    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
    * Circular Linked List

* ### Non-Linear Data Structures
In non-linear data structures, data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner. This structure does not follow a sequential order, allowing for more complex relationships between elements.

Common non-linear data structures include:

* Graph
* Trees

    * Binary Trees
    * Binary Search Trees
    * AVL Trees
* Heap
    
    * Max Heap
    * Min Heap 

* ### Other Data Structures

    * Hash
    * Set
    * Tries
    * Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
